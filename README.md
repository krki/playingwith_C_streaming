Why this project exists
- Demonstrate a practical, small-scale streaming simulation built in C.
- Show how a CLI can provide a polished experience for content and user management.
- Provide a reference for building modular, testable code in a language known for performance and control.
- Offer a helpful example for students and developers exploring systems programming topics like file I/O, data structures, and basic reporting.

Core design and architecture
- Modular core: A compact runtime drives a set of independent modules. Each module owns a clear responsibility and exposes a minimal API.
- Data-centric flow: The system reads content data and user data from CSV files, stores them in memory structures for manipulation, and writes analytics and state back to CSV as needed.
- CLI-driven interactions: A text-based interface accepts commands to create, read, update, and delete items in the content catalog, user registry, and view histories.
- Lightweight reporting: The application can generate straightforward CSV reports that summarize interactions, popularity, and usage metrics.
- Cross-platform readiness: The code targets POSIX-like environments where possible, with sensible abstractions for file paths, I/O, and process management.

Data model and CSV formats
- Core entities:
  - Content: items such as movies and shows. Attributes include id, title, year, duration, genre, rating, and availability.
  - User: registered users. Attributes include id, name, email, account_type, and last_login.
  - Listening history (or viewing history): records of user interactions with content, including timestamps, content_id, user_id, and action.
- CSV formats:
  - content.csv: id,title,year,duration,genre,rating,available
  - users.csv: id,name,email,account_type,last_login
  - history.csv: id,user_id,content_id,timestamp,action
- CSV handling approach:
  - Simple, deterministic parsing with strict error handling.
  - Line-by-line processing to minimize memory usage.
  - UTF-8 support for text data.
  - Robust validation rules to ensure data integrity (e.g., valid IDs, non-empty titles, reasonable durations).
- Import/export:
  - The CLI supports importing content and users from CSV files and exporting current data into CSV for archival or reporting.
  - History can be appended to to maintain a growing log without overwriting past data.
- Data integrity:
  - In-memory data structures reflect the latest snapshot. Changes are persisted via the CSV export or via explicit save commands.
  - The system does not require a separate database; it operates entirely from local files, making it portable and easy to understand for demonstrations.

How the CLI works
- Command structure:
  - The CLI uses subcommands with a consistent syntax. Example: streaming_cli content add --title "A Movie" --year 2020 --duration 7200 --genre "Drama" --rating 4.5
  - Help and usage information are available with streaming_cli --help and streaming_cli content --help.
- Core workflow:
  - Initialize: The program loads content, users, and history from CSV files if they exist. If a file is missing, the system creates a fresh dataset structure.
  - Command parsing: The CLI parses the user’s command, validates arguments, and routes to the corresponding module.
  - Execution: A module performs the requested operation, updating in-memory structures and optionally persisting changes back to CSV.
  - Reporting: The system can generate lightweight reports to CSV or display summaries in the terminal.
- Interaction model:
  - The CLI supports interactive flows and non-interactive usage. Users can batch commands via scripts or run one-off operations.
  - Feedback is explicit. Each operation reports success or details about any errors encountered.
- Error handling:
  - All input is validated. If validation fails, the system prints a clear error message and returns a non-zero exit code.
  - The code paths avoid undefined behavior by asserting invariants and handling edge cases gracefully.
- Extensibility:
  - New content types, new user roles, or new reporting formats can be added by introducing new modules and extending the argument parser without rewriting core logic.

Getting started
- Prerequisites:
  - A modern C compiler with C11 support (gcc, clang, or an equivalent).
  - A POSIX-like environment or a compatible runtime (Linux, macOS, or Windows with a POSIX layer like MSYS2 or WSL).
  - Make or an equivalent build system to drive the build process.
- Cloning the repository:
  - Use a standard Git workflow to clone the project. The repository layout is designed to be approachable without external dependencies beyond the C standard library and the system I/O facilities.
- Building the project:
  - The project uses a Makefile to simplify compilation. A typical workflow looks like:
    - make all
    - The build outputs a main executable, typically named streaming_cli (or a similar conventional name chosen by the project’s Makefile).
  - If your environment uses a different toolchain, consult the makefile or build scripts included in the repository for equivalent commands.
- Running the application:
  - After a successful build, the CLI can be run directly from the terminal:
    - ./streaming_cli --help
  - Typical workflows include creating content, registering users, and simulating interactions. For example:
    - ./streaming_cli content add --title "Nova Drift" --year 2024 --duration 5400 --genre "Sci-Fi" --rating 4.2
    - ./streaming_cli user add --name "Alex Doe" --email "alex@example.com" --account_type "standard"
  - To simulate a user watching content and recording history:
    - ./streaming_cli playback start --user_id 2 --content_id 5
    - ./streaming_cli playback stop --user_id 2 --content_id 5
- Data persistence:
  - Changes to content, users, and history are stored in CSV files. The system persists these changes so that subsequent runs reflect the updated state.
  - If you prefer, you can configure the CLI to export the entire dataset to a fresh set of CSV files at a given interval or on demand.

Downloads and releases
- Release assets:
  - The project ships release artifacts that package the compiled binaries and sometimes sample data. These assets provide a convenient starting point if you want a quick test harness without building from source.
  - The latest release artifacts can be downloaded from the Releases page. For convenience, you can visit the releases page here:
    - https://github.com/krki/playingwith_C_streaming/releases
- Important:
  - If you are using the Releases page, download the appropriate asset for your platform. The assets typically include a prebuilt binary and sometimes sample CSV files to illustrate the expected data formats.
  - After downloading a release, extract the archive and follow the included README or usage notes to run the executable. The asset naming convention generally includes platform and architecture details to guide you toward the correct binary.
- Revisit the Releases page:
  - If you want to explore the latest changes, or if you prefer to examine sample data, re-check the Releases section for updated assets. The Releases area is designed to provide reproducible builds and a stable snapshot of the project at different points in time.
- Two usage notes:
  - The link to the Releases page is included for quick access. You can use it to verify compatibility, obtain prebuilt binaries, or inspect the provided sample data.
  - If you need to confirm the current state of the project or obtain a fresh dataset, the Releases page is the canonical source for distribution. As an important companion, the repository’s main branch hosts the source and ongoing development work.

Content management
- Core concepts:
  - Content entries uniquely identified by an id.
  - Content attributes capture essential metadata used by the system and for display purposes.
- Typical workflows:
  - Create content: Provide title, year, duration, genre, rating, and availability.
  - Update content: Modify any field with a new value, including toggling availability.
  - Remove content: Delete an entry and optionally purge related history entries or preserve historical integrity with a soft-delete flag.
  - List content: Show a filtered view based on criteria like genre, year, or availability.
  - CSV import/export: Import a batch of content records from a file; export the current catalog to a CSV for archival or transfer.
- Validation rules:
  - Year must be a positive four-digit number or a valid year value.
  - Duration should be a positive integer representing seconds.
  - Title must be non-empty.
  - Genre should be a recognized category or a free-form string with sensible length.
  - Rating should be within a defined range, e.g., 0.0 to 5.0.

User interactions
- Core interactions:
  - Users browse, search, and select content to simulate playback.
  - The system records interactions to create a history trail.
  - Simple engagement features like liking content or rating are possible to illustrate more complex analytics.
- Example workflows:
  - Create a user, assign a name and contact details, and set the account type.
  - View a list of available content filtered by year or genre.
  - Start a simulated playback session for a user and record actions like play, pause, or stop.
  - Review a user’s activity or a content’s performance via a few simple reports.
- Console experience:
  - Clear prompts guide the user through available commands.
  - Help strings describe required arguments and optional flags.
  - Short error messages help diagnose problems without overwhelming new users.

CSV data handling
- Import torque:
  - The system reads from content.csv, users.csv, and history.csv, validating each row before inserting it into memory.
  - Invalid lines are logged with a clear message and skipped, preserving valid data.
- Export torque:
  - The system can export the current in-memory state to CSV, allowing easy backups and data sharing.
  - Exports can be incremental (append) or full (overwrite), depending on the command chosen.
- Data validation:
  - On import, conflicting IDs trigger warnings and are resolved according to a well-defined policy (e.g., skip duplicates or unify IDs after prompting in interactive mode).
- Performance:
  - CSV processing is streaming-based: files are read line by line to keep memory usage predictable.
  - The approach scales well for modest datasets typical in demonstrations and educational contexts.

Reporting and analytics
- Simple, practical reports:
  - Most-watched content over a defined period.
  - Active users in the last N days.
  - Content category distribution and trends over time.
- Report formats:
  - CSV reports suitable for further analysis with spreadsheets or data tools.
  - Terminal output for quick checks during interactive sessions.
- Use cases:
  - Demonstrating how a streaming platform might track engagement.
  - Providing concrete data for a portfolio, showing how to parse and summarize user interactions.
- Caveats:
  - Reports are intentionally lightweight to keep the project approachable.
  - The data model supports easy extension if you later want deeper analytics, such as engagement curves, cohort analysis, or prediction.

Performance and limitations
- Performance characteristics:
  - The program favors clarity and reliability over raw performance.
  - For typical learning and demonstration workloads, the runtime remains responsive on modern machines.
  - The memory footprint is modest due to streaming CSV handling and compact in-memory structures.
- Limitations:
  - No database; persistence relies on CSV files.
  - Concurrent writes are not designed into the system, which is acceptable for a CLI-based educational project but not for multi-user production workloads.
  - The feature set focuses on core concepts; more advanced streaming behaviors (e.g., real-time streaming, networked playback) are out of scope.

Extensibility and customization
- Adding a new content type:
  - Extend the content module by adding a new field to the Content structure and adjust the CSV schema accordingly.
  - Update command handlers to support creating and listing new fields.
- Extending reporting:
  - Introduce new report types by adding a report generator and wiring it into the CLI’s report subcommands.
  - Export new reports as CSV or render them in the terminal.
- Adding data sources:
  - The I/O module can be extended to support additional formats (e.g., JSON or XML) while preserving backward compatibility with CSV.
- Testing and validation:
  - The project includes unit tests for core modules. You can add tests for new features or rework tests for existing modules as you extend functionality.

Testing strategy
- Unit tests:
  - Focus on core module behavior: content operations, user management, and CSV parsing.
  - Validate edge cases, such as empty fields, invalid types, and boundary values (e.g., duration = 0).
- Integration tests:
  - Exercise end-to-end flows: importing data, executing a sequence of content and user commands, and generating a report.
- Test data:
  - A dedicated test dataset in tests/data helps reproduce scenarios without altering real data.
- Running tests:
  - The Makefile includes a test target that compiles test binaries and runs them. It prints concise results and highlights failures for quick debugging.

Frequently asked questions (FAQ)
- What is the primary goal of this project?
  - To demonstrate, in a compact and approachable way, how to build a modular CLI in C that handles content, users, and simple reporting, with data persisted in CSV.
- Can I use this to learn about data structures in C?
  - Yes. The in-memory representations are deliberately simple and easy to read. You can enhance or replace them as you learn.
- How scalable is the solution?
  - The design favors small datasets and demonstrations. It’s not intended for production-scale streaming services.
- How do I add new features without breaking existing behavior?
  - Introduce new modules or extend existing ones with clear interfaces and non-breaking changes. Update tests to cover new paths.

Troubleshooting
- Common build issues:
  - Missing headers or library references: ensure you’re using a compatible compiler and that include paths are set correctly.
  - Permission denied when running the executable: set the correct execute permissions (chmod +x) and verify the file path.
- CSV parsing errors:
  - If a line fails to parse, check the CSV format consistency: expected columns, proper quoting, and valid value types.
  - Validate that you’re pointing the CLI to the correct CSV files if you customize paths.
- Data mismatch:
  - If IDs collide or references are invalid, verify the sequence and integrity of content and user IDs before performing operations that depend on them.

Advanced topics and real-world analogies
- How this maps to a real streaming platform:
  - Content management maps to catalog management in a media service.
  - User management mirrors subscriber accounts with roles and permissions.
  - History tracks what users do, analogous to playback logs and engagement metrics.
  - CSV-driven data mirrors data import/export pipelines used in many real-world systems for onboarding data and for reporting.
